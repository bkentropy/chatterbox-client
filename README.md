#chatterbox-client
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta). This project was worked on with a pair.

#Summary
This application is designed to allow users to enter an instant messaging space, where there can be different rooms for differnt conversations.
This is the front-end part of the project and the back-end is handled by the parse API.
